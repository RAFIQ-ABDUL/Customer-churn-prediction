## Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed distributions and correlations.
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Used **Seaborn** for KDE plots and **Matplotlib** for boxplots.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature scaling and encoding.
   - Outlier handling to improve model robustness.
   - Train-test split for model validation.

3. **Pipeline**
   - Created a reproducible **data preprocessing + modeling pipeline** for consistency.

4. **Modeling**
   - Built an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
   - Optimized with activation functions.
   - Achieved:
     - **Accuracy:** 85%
     - **Validation Accuracy:** 85%
